Installation from Source Archive
================================

1. Download source tarball "fgn-backup-<VERSION>.tar.bz2".
2. Unpack using "tar xfj fgn-backup-<VERSION>.tar.bz2".
3. Change to directory "fgn-backup-<VERSION>".
4. Install files using "sudo make install".
   (You can change the install location from the default "/usr/local" bye
    specifying a different prefix: "sudo make PREFIX=<WHERETO> install")
5. Create a configuration file "/etc/fgn-backup". You can use the file
   "/usr/local/share/doc/fgn-backup/examples/fgn-backup.conf.example"
   as a starting point.
6. Place tar-exclude files in the file system roots to exclude e.g. temporary
   files/directories from the backup. There are two examples files, one for
   the "root" filesystem, the other for the "/var" filesystem in the example
   directory "/usr/local/doc/fgn-backup/examples". This assumes seperate
   filesystems for "root", "/usr", "/var", and so on.
7. Create a logrotate configuration file if you want to keep older backup
   logs on the local machine for easy reference. You can use the file
   "/usr/local/share/doc/fgn-backup/examples/fgn-backup.logrotate.example"
   as a starting point.
8. Create a file in /etc/cron.d to schedule backups. You can use the file
   "/usr/local/share/doc/fgn-backup/examples/fgn-backup.crontab.example"
   as a starting point.

Installation from TGZ Package
=============================
1. Download TGZ package "fgn-backup-<VERSION>.tgz".
2. Unpack it into the system root using "tar xfz fgn-backup-<VERSION>.tgz -C /".
3.-6. The same as points 5.-8. above.
